<h1>The Seven Fingered Pianist.</h1>
<p>I'm a Christian pianist who loves playing the piano and would like to be a benefit to my community both in person and online. </p>
<h1>How I became “The Seven-Fingered Pianist”</h1>
<p>My biological mother was addicted to alcohol and tobacco. My biological father is unknown. I was born with TAR-Syndrome. The cause is still unknown. TAR syndrome is a hand disability which is highlighted by a missing Radius bone or “long bone” which causes curved or “L” shape hands. Other symptoms of the syndrome include, low-set ears (which I have), heart defect (which I had but God healed it without any medical treatments).
<br>
 My adoptive parents believed that I should not think of myself as “disabled” but instead I should learn to adapt and do whatever I can on my own.
<br>
When my brothers came home, (one serves in the U.S. Coast Guard, and another is a church worship leader out of state) they both played the piano at our house. My mom is the pianist for both our churches, hence the beginning of my love for music, including Techno music (which is a form of computer science), and my desire for playing piano. I started learning the piano at the age of 10 years old and have been playing piano ever since. My love has grown even more for the art of music, both instrumental and modern platforms. I sometimes serve as the backup pianist at two churches and Has performed publicly on the 6th of August 2022, which is in my youtube channel.
<br>
My hope is to inspire other people with disabilities to not see themselves as others define them but to try to do what they can. Another hope of mine is to lead others to Christ and, with His help, to see what they truly can be.
<br>
Now more about me: I was born in Maryland and moved to West Virginia. My father, when he first saw my hands, said; “he won’t be able to play the piano because of his hands.” Now he enjoys listening to my piano and me playing for the church services.
<br>
Another hobby of mine is to create my own music whether on piano or just playing around with techno soundtracks.
